# Trivia Challenge

Hello and welcome to the repository for my first project at InceptionU. This is a trivia game where you can chose the amount of questions and the difficulty level. Each time a question is answered some data is written to a local JSON database. This data base tracks the difficulty of the question, what category and whether it was answered correctly or not. There is an option to view these stats on the score screen. 

## Install Instructions

NodeJS is required to load this app locally.

Upon cloning this repo simply run an `npm install` in your terminal.
\
This will install all the packages required to run the app.

From here simply start the server with `node server.js` in your terminal.

Now you can just visit `localhost:3000` in your browser and play!

I hope you enjoy playing some trivia, good luck and have fun!
