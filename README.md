## Process

I decided to make a trivia game in order to challenge myself in a few different aspects. My first challenge was to implement the question-and-answer data via API using async functions to fetch data from a public trivia API.

My next challenge was to generate the questions dynamically using JavaScript template literals. From there I needed to figure out the logic to check the selected answers against the fetched data and provide a visual representation whether the answer was correct or not. My initial implementation tackled SOME of the problems but it did not lock out the answering process. I initially tried several solutions from searching and ended up querying Chat GPT for a solution. This was my first-time using Chat GPT for coding solutions and I was impressed by the speed and ease I was able to find a solution.

At this point I have a fully working app. My next steps are to implement a simple local JSON database to track statistics on how many questions from each category were answered correctly. From there I’d like to include a graph at the score screen to show the user which categories they've most answered correctly.

In addition to the database, I’d like to refine the design and perhaps include some more animations to liven up the game.
