# <span style="color: #ffc400;">Trivia Challenge</span>

Hello and welcome to the repository for my first project at InceptionU.
\
This is a trivia game where you can chose the amount of questions and the difficulty level. 
\
Each time a question is answered some data is written to a local JSON database. 
\
This data base tracks the difficulty of the question, what category and whether it was answered correctly or not. 
\
There is an option to view these stats on the score screen. 

## <span style="color: #ffc400;">Installion Instructions</span>

NodeJS is required to load this app locally.

Upon cloning this repo run `npm install` in your terminal.
\
This will install all the packages required to run the app.
\
From here start the server with `node app.js` in your terminal.
\
Now you can just visit `localhost:3000` in your browser and play!
\
There is some JSON data already present so the graphs in the stats page have something to display.
\
If you'd like to start fresh replace all the data in the data.json file with an empty aray `[]`.

I hope you enjoy playing some trivia, good luck and have fun!
